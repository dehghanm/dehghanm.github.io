My name is Mahdi Dehghan. Being aware of my interest in computer science, I entered the Golestan University (GU) to get my B.Sc. in computer engineering. I was able to receive my B.Sc. degree holding 1st rank among 28 graduates of Computer Software Engineering in 2016. Though I could get the admission from the Talented Student Office at GU for graduate study, I participated in the national university entrance examination for higher education in 2016 to pursue my study at a top university. I was admitted to Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), one of the most recognized universities in Iran. Currently, I am a graduated master student who did my researches under the supervision of [Dr. Ahmad Ali Abin](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/abin/){:target="\_blank"}. In my master's thesis, I worked on detecting experts and shaped of them in CQA networks.

My research interests include information retrieval, machine learning techniques in both textual and non-textual data, recommender systems, social networks, and natural language processing.
