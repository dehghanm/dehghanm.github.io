My name is Mahdi Dehghan and I recently graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University under the suppervision of [Dr. Ahmad Ali Abins](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/abin/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests include information retrieval, machine learning techniques in both textual and non-textual data, recommender systems, social networks, and natural language processing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
